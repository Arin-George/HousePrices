House Prices Prediction Model

A machine learning project built using XGBoost Regressor in Jupyter Notebook to accurately estimate housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling, to ensure optimal model performance. XGBoost’s gradient boosting algorithm is leveraged for its high accuracy, robustness, and ability to handle non-linear relationships. The model is trained, validated, and evaluated using performance metrics like R² score and RMSE to assess predictive power. This project demonstrates practical machine learning implementation for real estate pricing, enabling data-driven decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors.
